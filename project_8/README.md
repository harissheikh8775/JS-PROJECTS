# ðŸ“˜ JavaScript Strings Tutorial

Welcome to the **JavaScript Strings Tutorial**. This script is a beginner-friendly introduction to handling strings in JavaScript. It walks through examples of how to access characters, find the length of a string, and search for substrings using `.indexOf()`.

---

## ðŸ§  What You'll Learn

- Using **template literals** for dynamic strings.
- Accessing **characters** in a string using index notation.
- Using the `.length` property to find the length of a string.
- Finding **positions of substrings** using `.indexOf()`.

## ðŸ“œ Code Summary

```js
console.log("Hi there!");

const botName = "teacherBot";
const greeting = `My name is ${botName}.`;
console.log(greeting);

const subject = "JavaScript";
const topic = "strings";

const sentence = `Today, you will learn about ${topic} in ${subject}.`;
console.log(sentence);

const strLengthIntro = `Here is an example of using the length property on the word ${subject}.`;
console.log(strLengthIntro);
console.log(subject.length); // Length of "JavaScript"

console.log(`Here is an example of using the length property on the word ${topic}.`);
console.log(topic.length); // Length of "strings"

console.log(`Here is an example of accessing the first letter in the word ${subject}.`);
console.log(subject[0]); // 'J'

console.log(`Here is an example of accessing the second letter in the word ${subject}.`);
console.log(subject[1]); // 'a'

console.log(`Here is an example of accessing the last letter in the word ${subject}.`);
const lastCharacter = subject[subject.length - 1];
console.log(lastCharacter); // 't'

const learningIsFunSentence = "Learning is fun.";
console.log("Here are examples of finding the positions of substrings in the sentence.");
console.log(learningIsFunSentence.indexOf("Learning")); // 0
console.log(learningIsFunSentence.indexOf("fun")); // 13
console.log(learningIsFunSentence.indexOf("learning")); // -1 (case-sensitive)

console.log("I hope you enjoyed learning today.");

âœ… Concepts Used
template literals â€” ${variable} syntax inside backticks `

.length â€” counts the number of characters

[] â€” accesses individual characters using index

.indexOf() â€” returns index of first occurrence or -1 if not found
